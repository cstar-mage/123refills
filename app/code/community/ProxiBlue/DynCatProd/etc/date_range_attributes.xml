This file defines any attributes that should be conveted to the date range display in the rules

Normal magento convention is to name attribute code in the form of _to and _from for attributes that work in pairs
to define the ability to make a date range.
An example of this is new_from and new_to which defines when a product is set to be new
The module will automatically convert attributes where the codes conform to the convention, however there may be times when
other custom or 3rd party attributes do not conform. This file can then be placed to allow those to work as a
date range attribute

These attributes are defined in pairs, as start and end in the xml

<date_range>
    <transform>
        <description>The description for this date range that will appear in the rules dropdown</description>
        <code>
            <start>Attribute pair start attribute_code</start>
            <end>Attribute pair end attribute_code</end>
        </code>
    </transform>
</date_range>
